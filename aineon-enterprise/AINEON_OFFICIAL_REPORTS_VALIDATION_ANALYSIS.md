4. **AINEON Internal Benchmarks** (actual tested performance)

## Reality of Elite Trading Firm Disclosures

### 🔒 **Why No Public Data?**

Elite trading firms **DO NOT** publicly disclose:

1. **Performance Metrics**: Latency, success rates, profit figures
2. **Technical Specifications**: Infrastructure details, system architecture
3. **Operational Data**: Daily volumes, market share, strategy performance
4. **Financial Information**: Revenue, profits, capital allocation

### 📊 **Typical Industry Practices**

- **Proprietary Information**: Performance data is highly confidential
- **Competitive Sensitivity**: Sharing metrics would reveal strategy weaknesses
- **Regulatory Environment**: Limited disclosure requirements for private firms
- **Client Confidentiality**: Most trading is done for own account, not clients

## Industry Context: Why This Is Normal

| Firm | Public Disclosures | Performance Data | Technical Info |
|------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Jump Trading** | Minimal | None | None |
| **Wintermute** | Minimal | None | None |
| **Alameda** | Minimal | None | None |
